## Installation

Click [here](https://github.com/dolph/gerrit-review-counts/raw/master/gerrit-review-counts.user.js).

I've only tested this with [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) *v3.11* on [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) *v44.0.2403.157*. If you're using a different browser, you'll need to find whatever extension (if necessary) provides support for User Scripts.
